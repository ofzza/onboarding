### GitHub resources

#### Readme

Every project needs a README file. Use this template to get started: [README.md](./RESOURCES/GitHub/README.md)

#### Templates:

GitHub templates can be set by the repository administrator and are a good way of nudging developers to keep consistency in their issue and PR content and formatting:

- [New issue template](./RESOURCES/GitHub/templates/issue.md)
- [New pull-request template](./RESOURCES/GitHub/templates/pull-request.md)

#### GitHub Projects Plus browser extension:

The GitHub Projects Plus browser extension updates GitHub's UI to provide you with different types of labels for different purposes. Typically it is good practice to differentiate between following types:

- Domain labels

  > Should all be named starting with a "`#`" character and are used to position an issue or pull request into a certain domain of interest, for example: `#api`, `#webclient`, `#mobile`.

- Status labels

  > Should all be named starting with a "`@`" character and are used to signify current status of an issue or pull request, for example: `@blocked`, `@complete`, `@tested`.

- Descriptor labels

  > All other, ordinary labels, used to further classify and describe an issue or pull request.
