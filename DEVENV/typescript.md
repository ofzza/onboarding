### JavaScript project setup

See about first configuring your project as a JavaScript project [here](./javascript.md)

Before starting with your project, **unless `tslint.json` is already provided by some project creation tool like `ng`**, download configuration for TSlint from here: [tslint.json](../RESOURCES/TypeScript/tslint.json)
